PYTHON PROGRAMMING INTRODUCTION
Python is a high level, interpreted and general purpose programming language.
-> it is designed to be easy to read, write and powerful enough to build several apps in different domains - can build almost anything
-> written in pseudo code and is easily readable.
->compared to compiled languages that are written in machine code or binary code and are not executed line by line.

WHY PYTHON
1. Simple and readable syntax
2. Less code, more power - what might take a languange like Java, C++ 10 lines to execute, Python may exeecute the same program in 2 lines.
3. Interpreted language **doesn't need to compile**
   -> the code runs just by running the python files directly.
4. Massive community and libraries
5. Cross platform -> can run on any OS or system - Windows, Linux, MacOS

Python Applications
1. Web Development
2. Data Science and Machine Learning
3. Cybersecurity
4. Game development
5. Robotics

CREATING A PYTHON FILE
-> all python files have the .py extension
-> think of it like a box used to store data in programming
-> Simplest way to store data in programming
e.g
x = 10
x --> variable
10 --> value

N/B
variables are given a name of your choice but they have to follow variable naming rules
xyz = 19

Variables naming rules/conventions
1. Variables can only contain letters, numbers and underscores
   e.g full_name1 **valid variable\*
   !name **invalid\*

2. Can only start with a letter or an underscore --> Can't start with a number
   e.g \_name **valid\*
   name **valid*
   23name \*\*invalid*

3. Variable names are case sensitive
   -> name, Name, NAME are all different variables
   -> x and X are different variables

4. Variable names can't be Python keywords - you can't assign variables reserved keywordds

**It is good practise to give variables meaningful names**
email = "email.com"
x = "email.com"

5. They also can't have spaces
   i.e full name **invalid\*
   fullname **valid*
   full_name \*\*valid*

OUTPUTING VALUES
print() \*_function used to output values_

-DATA TYPES
-> a data type tells python what kind of value something is and what operations can be done with it.
-> every variable has a type depending on the value it holds.

*Python data types*
-numeric data types
 they hold numeric values
Categorized into two:
 a. intergers => whole numbers e.g 20, 30, 12
   **denoted as int**
 b. float => floating point numbers or decimal numbers e.g 6.7, 77.4, 4.0999
  **denoted as float**
  
-textual data types
 data that is in text form(text-based data)
 -denoted as str
 => string - a sequence of characters -letters, numbers, symbols, spaces etc 
 => are encolosed in quotations ("", '')
 **enables python to work with text*

-boolean data types
-> data types used to represent truth values
-> (True, False)
-denoted as bool
is_adult = True

1. int
2. float
3. str
4. bool

---> to identify any type of data in python we use type() function
---> 

=>*TAKING USER INPUT**
getting data from the program 
in python we use input()
i.e user_input = input("Enter anything....")

N/B **any data coming from user input will always be a string.**

print()-output
type()- checks data type
input()- taking user input from the user from the terminal.

yellow error - undefined
red error - syntax erroe

python is strict on indentation rules meaning no unexpected indentation and spaces
it throws a syntax error.

**Comments & multiline strings
--> comment code is not executed
---> we use #

Multiline string is a string that traverses more than one line 
--> we use triple ('')single quotes or ("") double quotes.

TYPE CASTING
--> converting the type of a variable to another
i.e a string to a float

#bool conversion
1 => True
0 => False


String operations
=> how you can manipulate string data types.

1. Concatenation -> combining 2 or more atrings to one
 *we use (+)

2. Indexing ->each character in a variable is given an index(helps access the characters)
 --> python starts counting from 0
 --> spaces are counted are characters
 --> to determine the index of character we use [] ->square brackets 
 --> can work in the reverse by starting from -1

3. Length -> determining how many characters are in a string. (len()) function
4. Slicing -> used to extract a piece of a string from the full string
 --> has a starting point and an ending point
 --> uses indexing
5. Casing -> changing the case (uppercase)/(lowercase)

TASK
1. .strip() -> removes whitespaces from both sides.
2. .lstrip() -> removes whitespaces from the left side.
3. .rstrip() -> removes whitespaces from the right side.
4. .title() -> capitalize the first character of a string.
5. .index() -> returns the index of the first occurrence of the passed character of a string.
6. .find() -> similar to index(returns the index of a character in a string).
7. .count() -> checks the number of times a character appears in a string.
8. .endswith() & .startswith() -> checks whether the string starts with or ends with the character passed and returns \true or false\
9. .isupper() & .islower() -> checks whether a string is in uppercase or lowercase \returns boolean\
10. .split() -> separates a string at the given separator and returns a list.
11. .join() -> join iterable items.

12. .formatted string f('') -> enables you to include variable names in string data
13. .replace ->replaces a character in a string with another character.

INTERGER & FLOAT OPERATIONS
1.Addition -<+>
2.Subtraction -<->
3.Division -</>
4.Multiplication -<*>

=> exponentiation (**)
=> floor division (//)
=> modulus (%)

DATA STRUCTURES / DATA COLLECTIONS
-> to store multiple data items together in a single memory location or variable.

Types of data structures/collections.
1.List 
2.Tuples
3.Dictionary
4.Sets

*Lists*
ordered and mutable collection of items of different data types.
can store items of any type
denoted by square brackets[]
 fruits = ["mango", "apple", "banana"]

Properties of lists
=>they are ordered - uses index to access/order items 
=>can store items of any data type 
   i.e items = ["Ken", 1, 2, 4.654, True]
=> can store multiple items
=> are mutable -> the value of items in the list can be changed.  
=> values in a list are accessed using index.
=> values in a list are separated by a comma.

**list can contain any data type
**list can contain another list


LIST METHODS
-Adding items to a list
**append() -> adds items at the end of a list
**extend() -> adds multiple items at the end of a list using a list (pass a list)
**insert() -> adds an item at a specific index

Removing items from a list
**remove() -> removes an item by value
**pop() -> removes an item at a specified index
        -> if no index has been specifies it removes the last value    
**clear() -> removes everything from the list

Task 
1.count() -> counts the number of elements with the specified value.
2.index() -> returns the index of the first element with the the value passed.
3.sort() -> arranges a list in alphanumeric and ascending.
4.reverse() -> changes the order of the list from the last item to the first.
5.max() -> returns the largest value in a dataset
6.min() -> returs the smallest value in a dataset
7.copy() -> returns a copy of the list
 **use either the copy method, list keyword or the slice [:] operator.
8.how to join 2 lists(hint: 2methods)
 -> use append whereby you add the items in the second list to the original by looping
  (for x in list1:
   list2.append(x))
 -> use + operator 
 -> use extend() to add the list to the end of the other list

9.slide task 35

Tuples
data structures used to hold multiple values that can't be changed or removed.
Denoted using normal brackets.()

**properties / characteristics of tuples
-> are ordered --> uses index to access/order items
-> are immutable --> values can't be changed
-> can hold multiple values of any type

TASK
1. How to update a tuple 
 -> adding / removing / changing items in a tuple.
2. task slide 38

SETS
a collection of unique, unordered items.
-Represented using curly braces -{}
 
 Properties of sets
 -they are unordered -> don't have indexing
 -their values are unique -> no duplicate values
